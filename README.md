swiftstrap
==========

A GUI builder for twitter bootstrap applications

1. Initially, the front end will be designed in Flash, with a PHP backend to dynamically create bootstrapped HTML files.
2. The idea is to create a simple and easy to use clone of Microsoft Visual Studio.
3. If this gets big I may choose to change the license from GPL to a commercial one.
